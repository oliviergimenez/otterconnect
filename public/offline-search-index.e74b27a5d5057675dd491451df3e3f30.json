Depending on the size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy User Guide).\nTry answering these questions for your user in this page:\nWhat is it? Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.\nWhy do I want it? Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include:\nWhat is it good for?: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?\nWhat is it not good for?: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren’t for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.\nWhat is it not yet good for?: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.\nWhere should I go next?

The full documentation can be found here.\nWork with R markdown One example Rmarkdown file, /content/en/rmarkdown/examples/example_rmd.Rmd is also included in the skeleton.\nTo modify website content, after running blogdown::serve_site(), change files in /content/en directory.\nChange _/content/en/index.html for the homepage.\nRead about the homepage background image. Add your md or Rmd files inside the /content/en folder.\nWhen you are writing the Rmarkdown files, a good practice is to only use one level 1 heading (\"#\"). This theme has already created a H1 for you which is the main title, so try to aviod the H1 heading in other part of the document. By default, this template assumes you are not using other H1 headings and the table of content (TOC) starts with H2, and other additional H1 heading will be displayed in main text but will not show up on the TOC. If you wish to start with H1 on your TOC, change [markup.tableOfContents] in /config.toml.\nWhen you save your modified Rmarkdown files, {blogdown} will automatically render the file from filename.Rmd to filename.md extension. This new .md will be used by Hugo to generate HTML. Usually you do not manually edit this .md file.\nAfter the .md generation, changes will be reflected in the local browser in a second.\nBefore building the website, check out docs for new features.\nView .Rmd source By default, the View source code button will be display both on the right toc panel and the main content panel. Usually this button will create links point to the raw source code .md file stored on Github. However, if you are writing a .Rmd file, this theme will detect if you have a file that has the same name as the .md file but with .Rmd extension stored under the same folder. If so, the View source code button becomes View Rmd source and it will create a link point to the .Rmd file on Github instead of the .md file.\nSee the difference of the button under the main title on Basic R Markdown page and this page.\nPages Types Because most technical documentation sites have different sections for different types of content, the Docsy theme comes with the following templates for top-level site sections that you might need:\ndocs is for pages in your site’s Documentation section. blog is for pages in your site’s Blog. community is for your site’s Community page. For the new Rmarkdown, it is necessary to specify the content page type:\n--- title: \"New Rmarkdown\" author: \"\u003cAuthor\u003e\" date: \"02/07/2021\" output: html_document type: docs weight: 5 --- Other Content Content sections and templates\nNavigation and Search\nAdding a version drop-down\nChange website tab logo You could change the website logo following the docsy documents. Here we are talking about the logo appears on the browser tab, not the one on the top left corner.\nPrepare a not too large png image (ideally only a square image, transparent background). The size does not need to be too big 500x500 pixel will be good enough, but do not be very small, at least 200x200. Go to website like https://www.favicon-generator.org/, https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or others to generate you favicons. Then download the bundle. Remove files inside /static/favicons, do not remove the folder. Unzip all content into the /static/favicons. You should see many images files, like android, apple, etc. Then you should see the tab icon updated. Build the website If you are ready to publish the website, use\nblogdown::build_site(build_rmd = \"md5sum\") All website content is in the /public folder. Only this folder is required to publish your website.\nRead deploy for some convenient ways we provide to publish the website.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Create your website content This Docsy Template Project uses the Docsy …","ref":"/rmarkdown/newcontent/","tags":"","title":"Add new content"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page.

However if there are areas where your users will need a more detailed understanding of a given term or feature in order to do anything useful with your project (or to not make mistakes when using it) put that information in this section. For example, you may want to add some conceptual pages if you have a large project with many components and a complex architecture.\nRemember to focus on what the user needs to know, not just what you think is interesting about your project! If they don’t need to understand your original design decisions to use or contribute to the project, don’t put them in, or include your design docs in your repo and link to them. Similarly, most users will probably need to know more about how features work when in use rather than how they are implemented. Consider a separate architecture page for more detailed implementation and system design information that potential project contributors can consult.\n","categories":"","description":"What does your user need to understand about your project in order to use it - or potentially contribute to it? \n","excerpt":"What does your user need to understand about your project in order to …","ref":"/docs/concepts/","tags":"","title":"Concepts"},{"body":"Deploy to GitHub Pages Key feature: Fully automatic, no need to build website locally. Yes, you can skip blogdown::build_site() step locally.\n1. Add all R and system packages to /deps.yaml file that are required to render your Rmarkdown files Specify any CRAN, Bioconductor or Github packages you have used, in yaml array format. Github packages need to be user_name/repo_name. The site building is happening on Github by an Ubuntu system, so specify any system packages to install that are required by your R packages. Only a single line, use space to separate each system dependencies. 2. Change base URL in config file Change your baseURL in the /config.toml.\nIf this is your first github website, change the baseURL = “/” to your github base url, like “https://USERNAME.github.io/”. If not, change baseURL = “/” to your repo’s url, like “https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/”. If you use custom domain, change baseURL = “/” to your custom url, like “https://MY_DOMAIN_NAME.com/”. 3. Create a new branch named gh-pages git checkout -b gh-pages rm -rv !(.git|README.md) git add . \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"gh-pages\" \u0026\u0026 git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages git checkout main git add . \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"pg_build\" \u0026\u0026 git push git submodule update --init --recursive Or go to Github website create a branch by clicking.\nYou do not need to push any content to this gh-pages branch. This branch is automatically managed by Github Actions.\n4. Github Setting Click on Setting click on GitHub Pages Select Branch gh-pages and folder /(root) and click on Save Click on Enforce HTTPS 5. Trigger page build To trigger a build and deployment event, in the git commit message, include the word “pg_build”, e.g. git commit -m \"blabla pg_build\". This will run the full rendering process (rendering and deploy the website may still take a few minutes). If you have build the site locally and updated the /public locally, in your commit message, include the word “no_render” will skip the site rendering + build process. Github Actions will directly use /public to host the website. 6. Add CNAME file cname If the webpage requires CNAME file, we can set the cname option in the .github/workflows/build_page.yaml.\nFor more details about CNAME, read the official documentation: Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - GitHub Help.\n- name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public cname: \u003cadd CNAME\u003e Details The first deployment can take some time because Github Actions need to install these packages. After first successful deployment with Github Actions, all packages will be cached and no need to install again later. So later deployment will be much faster. Deploy to Netlify Important: :\nBefore running blogdown::build_site(), in /config.toml change baseURL to “/” baseURL=\"/\" Before deployment, in /netlify.toml change publish to “public” publish = \"public\" Deploy to Netlify with GitHub Go online to Netlify.com. Click on the Sign Up button. It is recommended to sign up using your existing GitHub account, so select GitHub, and click to Authorize Netlify. Click on the New site from Git button. Click on the GitHub button. Select the repository you just created it. Click on Show advanced and then New Variable: Specify HUGO_VERSION as the Key for the new variable, and 0.79.0 for the Value.

This time parent is required and the value should be the name value for which the entry you want to attach to. weight decides the order within the dropdown list This website’s documentation menu is created by this example:\n[[menu.main]] name = \"Documentation\" weight = 1 url = \"/docs/\" [[menu.main]] name = \"overview\" url = \"/docs/overview/\" parent = \"Documentation\" weight = 1 Dropdown indentation If you wish to have some indentation in the dropdown menu, in config.toml, write the menu part as following:\n[[menu.main]] name = \"Documentation\" weight = 1 url = \"/docs/\" [[menu.main]] name = \"First level\" url = \"https://www.docsy.dev/docs/\" parent = \"Documentation\" weight = 1 [[menu.main]] name = \"Second level\" url = \"https://www.docsy.dev/docs/\" parent = \"Documentation\" weight = 2 [menu.main.params] level = 2 In addition to specify the parent param, also attach the level under [menu.main.params]. The level means indentation level. When not specified, it is the default 1. The value can be any float value between 0 and infinity. The indentation space is level * 1rem. So you can do something like level = 1.5. However, we encourage you to use integers than float numbers.\nShow/hide sidebars toggle This feature is only available in document pages. 2 toggle buttons are on the top-right corner of the page. You can switch them off to hide left/right sidebars to create more space on small screens.\nAutomatic deployment to Github pages or Netlify We added automatic deployment with Github Actions and instructions to Netlify, read deploy for details.\nHide document before the specified date Sometimes for class teaching or other requirements, some pages need to be hidden before a specific date. We have added this support:\nIn your markdown/ R markdown header, add visibleDate date entry and specify a date in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, for example\n--- title: \"Overview\" linkTitle: \"Overview\" weight: 1 visibleDate: \"2021-02-01\" --- The document will not be visible before February 1st, year 2021.

Content will automatically become visible for readers.\nhard: Content is removed during markdown/Rmarkdown to HTML generation.\nWhole content will not be sent to readers. However, you need to rebuild + redeploy the site after the visible date. Content will NOT automatically become visible for readers.\nWe recommend to use “soft” for non-top secrets, like normal documents for a tool. For site with sensitive content like exam solutions, “hard” may be better.\nTable of content highlighting and scrolling Right side table of content (TOC) bar will be automatically highlighted for readers current visible sections titles. This is a good indicator to show where the users are.\nIf the TOC is too long, when readers scroll the page, TOC bar will automatically scroll as well.\nLinks with target=\"_blank\" If you want users to open a new tab when click a Rmarkdown link, add {t_blank} in the end of the link text.\nnormal link:\n[a link to google](https://www.google.com) a link to google\nlink with target=\"_blank\":\n[a link to google{t_blank}](https://www.google.com) a link to google{t_blank}\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"New features we have added along with the R markdown support.

Use these to choose your core tasks. Each granular use case (enable x, configure y) should have a corresponding tasks page or tasks page section. Users should be able to quickly refer to your core tasks when they need to find out how to do one specific thing, rather than having to look for the instructions in a bigger tutorial or example. Think of your tasks pages as a cookbook with different procedures your users can combine to create something more substantial.\nYou can give each task a page, or you can group related tasks together in a page, such as tasks related to a particular feature. As well as grouping related tasks in single pages, you can also group task pages in nested folders with an index page as an overview, as seen in this example site. Or if you have a small docset like the Docsy User Guide with no Tutorials or Concepts pages, consider adding your feature-specific pages at the top level of your docs rather than in a Tasks section.\nEach task should give the user\nThe prerequisites for this task, if any (this can be specified at the top of a multi-task page if they’re the same for all the page’s tasks. “All these tasks assume that you understand….and that you have already….”). What this task accomplishes. Instructions for the task. If it involves editing a file, running a command, or writing code, provide code-formatted example snippets to show the user what to do!

You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\nFork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress.

Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers. Updating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\nClick Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes. Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\nFollow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\nFork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\nContinue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\nCreating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.
