[{"body":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.\nWhen you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\nsummary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56.00 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120.00 Math $$\\sum(a+b)$$\nInline math \\(\\sum(a+b)\\).\nIncluding Plots You can also embed plots, for example:\nNote that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\nViolin Plot with ggplot2 # Library library(ggplot2) # create a dataset data \u003c- data.frame( name=c( rep(\"A\",500), rep(\"B\",500), rep(\"B\",500), rep(\"C\",20), rep('D', 100) ), value=c( rnorm(500, 10, 5), rnorm(500, 13, 1), rnorm(500, 18, 1), rnorm(20, 25, 4), rnorm(100, 12, 1) ) ) # Most basic violin chart p \u003c- ggplot(data, aes(x=name, y=value, fill=name)) + # fill=name allow to automatically dedicate a color for each group geom_violin() p Violin Plot with interactive plot (plotly) library(plotly) ggplotly(p) Add references (R Core Team 2020).\nReferences R Core Team. 2020.

The full documentation can be found here.\nWork with R markdown One example Rmarkdown file, /content/en/rmarkdown/examples/example_rmd.Rmd is also included in the skeleton.\nTo modify website content, after running blogdown::serve_site(), change files in /content/en directory.\nChange _/content/en/index.html for the homepage.\nRead about the homepage background image. Add your md or Rmd files inside the /content/en folder.\nWhen you are writing the Rmarkdown files, a good practice is to only use one level 1 heading (\"#\"). This theme has already created a H1 for you which is the main title, so try to aviod the H1 heading in other part of the document. By default, this template assumes you are not using other H1 headings and the table of content (TOC) starts with H2, and other additional H1 heading will be displayed in main text but will not show up on the TOC. If you wish to start with H1 on your TOC, change [markup.tableOfContents] in /config.toml.\nWhen you save your modified Rmarkdown files, {blogdown} will automatically render the file from filename.Rmd to filename.md extension. This new .md will be used by Hugo to generate HTML. Usually you do not manually edit this .md file.\nAfter the .md generation, changes will be reflected in the local browser in a second.\nBefore building the website, check out docs for new features.\nView .Rmd source By default, the View source code button will be display both on the right toc panel and the main content panel. Usually this button will create links point to the raw source code .md file stored on Github. However, if you are writing a .Rmd file, this theme will detect if you have a file that has the same name as the .md file but with .Rmd extension stored under the same folder. If so, the View source code button becomes View Rmd source and it will create a link point to the .Rmd file on Github instead of the .md file.\nSee the difference of the button under the main title on Basic R Markdown page and this page.\nPages Types Because most technical documentation sites have different sections for different types of content, the Docsy theme comes with the following templates for top-level site sections that you might need:\ndocs is for pages in your site’s Documentation section. blog is for pages in your site’s Blog. community is for your site’s Community page. For the new Rmarkdown, it is necessary to specify the content page type:\n--- title: \"New Rmarkdown\" author: \"\u003cAuthor\u003e\" date: \"02/07/2021\" output: html_document type: docs weight: 5 --- Other Content Content sections and templates\nNavigation and Search\nAdding a version drop-down\nChange website tab logo You could change the website logo following the docsy documents. Here we are talking about the logo appears on the browser tab, not the one on the top left corner.\nPrepare a not too large png image (ideally only a square image, transparent background). The size does not need to be too big 500x500 pixel will be good enough, but do not be very small, at least 200x200. Go to website like https://www.favicon-generator.org/, https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or others to generate you favicons. Then download the bundle. Remove files inside /static/favicons, do not remove the folder. Unzip all content into the /static/favicons. You should see many images files, like android, apple, etc. Then you should see the tab icon updated. Build the website If you are ready to publish the website, use\nblogdown::build_site(build_rmd = \"md5sum\") All website content is in the /public folder. Only this folder is required to publish your website.\nRead deploy for some convenient ways we provide to publish the website.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Create your website content This Docsy Template Project uses the Docsy …","ref":"/rmarkdown/newcontent/","tags":"","title":"Add new content"},{"body":"Deploy to GitHub Pages Key feature: Fully automatic, no need to build website locally. Yes, you can skip blogdown::build_site() step locally.\n1. Add all R and system packages to /deps.yaml file that are required to render your Rmarkdown files Specify any CRAN, Bioconductor or Github packages you have used, in yaml array format. Github packages need to be user_name/repo_name. The site building is happening on Github by an Ubuntu system, so specify any system packages to install that are required by your R packages. Only a single line, use space to separate each system dependencies. 2. Change base URL in config file Change your baseURL in the /config.toml.\nIf this is your first github website, change the baseURL = “/” to your github base url, like “https://USERNAME.github.io/”. If not, change baseURL = “/” to your repo’s url, like “https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO_NAME/”. If you use custom domain, change baseURL = “/” to your custom url, like “https://MY_DOMAIN_NAME.com/”. 3. Create a new branch named gh-pages git checkout -b gh-pages rm -rv !(.git|README.md) git add . \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"gh-pages\" \u0026\u0026 git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages git checkout main git add . \u0026\u0026 git commit -m \"pg_build\" \u0026\u0026 git push git submodule update --init --recursive Or go to Github website create a branch by clicking.\nYou do not need to push any content to this gh-pages branch. This branch is automatically managed by Github Actions.\n4. Github Setting Click on Setting click on GitHub Pages Select Branch gh-pages and folder /(root) and click on Save Click on Enforce HTTPS 5. Trigger page build To trigger a build and deployment event, in the git commit message, include the word “pg_build”, e.g. git commit -m \"blabla pg_build\". This will run the full rendering process (rendering and deploy the website may still take a few minutes). If you have build the site locally and updated the /public locally, in your commit message, include the word “no_render” will skip the site rendering + build process. Github Actions will directly use /public to host the website. 6. Add CNAME file cname If the webpage requires CNAME file, we can set the cname option in the .github/workflows/build_page.yaml.\nFor more details about CNAME, read the official documentation: Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - GitHub Help.\n- name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public cname: \u003cadd CNAME\u003e Details The first deployment can take some time because Github Actions need to install these packages. After first successful deployment with Github Actions, all packages will be cached and no need to install again later. So later deployment will be much faster. Deploy to Netlify Important: :\nBefore running blogdown::build_site(), in /config.toml change baseURL to “/” baseURL=\"/\" Before deployment, in /netlify.toml change publish to “public” publish = \"public\" Deploy to Netlify with GitHub Go online to Netlify.com. Click on the Sign Up button. It is recommended to sign up using your existing GitHub account, so select GitHub, and click to Authorize Netlify. Click on the New site from Git button. Click on the GitHub button. Select the repository you just created it. Click on Show advanced and then New Variable: Specify HUGO_VERSION as the Key for the new variable, and 0.79.0 for the Value. Click on Deploy site. Deploy to Netlify button NOTE: Gitib does not allow third party tools to create/modify Github actions workflows and this template contains workflows, so clicking the button above will not copy code to your new repository, but it will publish website to netlify.

This time parent is required and the value should be the name value for which the entry you want to attach to. weight decides the order within the dropdown list This website’s documentation menu is created by this example:\n[[menu.main]] name = \"Documentation\" weight = 1 url = \"/docs/\" [[menu.main]] name = \"overview\" url = \"/docs/overview/\" parent = \"Documentation\" weight = 1 Dropdown indentation If you wish to have some indentation in the dropdown menu, in config.toml, write the menu part as following:\n[[menu.main]] name = \"Documentation\" weight = 1 url = \"/docs/\" [[menu.main]] name = \"First level\" url = \"https://www.docsy.dev/docs/\" parent = \"Documentation\" weight = 1 [[menu.main]] name = \"Second level\" url = \"https://www.docsy.dev/docs/\" parent = \"Documentation\" weight = 2 [menu.main.params] level = 2 In addition to specify the parent param, also attach the level under [menu.main.params]. The level means indentation level. When not specified, it is the default 1. The value can be any float value between 0 and infinity. The indentation space is level * 1rem. So you can do something like level = 1.5. However, we encourage you to use integers than float numbers.\nShow/hide sidebars toggle This feature is only available in document pages. 2 toggle buttons are on the top-right corner of the page. You can switch them off to hide left/right sidebars to create more space on small screens.\nAutomatic deployment to Github pages or Netlify We added automatic deployment with Github Actions and instructions to Netlify, read deploy for details.\nHide document before the specified date Sometimes for class teaching or other requirements, some pages need to be hidden before a specific date. We have added this support:\nIn your markdown/ R markdown header, add visibleDate date entry and specify a date in ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, for example\n--- title: \"Overview\" linkTitle: \"Overview\" weight: 1 visibleDate: \"2021-02-01\" --- The document will not be visible before February 1st, year 2021. Hour, minute, second are optional.\nNote: hours are in 24 hour format. Hour, minute, second must be provided all together, providing a single, or two of them will not work.\nYYYY-MM-DD HH not work YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS not work YYYY-MM-DD SS not work YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS work! Go to /config.toml change serverTimeLocation your server time zone location Change it to the time zone location of where your website rendering server (where do you run blogdown::build_site()).

If some browsers block javascript, some content may leak to reader. However, you do not need to rebuild the site after the visible date. Content will automatically become visible for readers.\nhard: Content is removed during markdown/Rmarkdown to HTML generation.\nWhole content will not be sent to readers. However, you need to rebuild + redeploy the site after the visible date. Content will NOT automatically become visible for readers.\nWe recommend to use “soft” for non-top secrets, like normal documents for a tool. For site with sensitive content like exam solutions, “hard” may be better.\nTable of content highlighting and scrolling Right side table of content (TOC) bar will be automatically highlighted for readers current visible sections titles. This is a good indicator to show where the users are.\nIf the TOC is too long, when readers scroll the page, TOC bar will automatically scroll as well.\nLinks with target=\"_blank\" If you want users to open a new tab when click a Rmarkdown link, add {t_blank} in the end of the link text.\nnormal link:\n[a link to google](https://www.google.com) a link to google\nlink with target=\"_blank\":\n[a link to google{t_blank}](https://www.google.com) a link to google{t_blank}\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"New features we have added along with the R markdown support.
