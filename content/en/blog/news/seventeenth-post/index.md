We got some funding from the University of Montpellier through Labex CeMEB to do science outreach. MEDLEZ is a scientific outreach project designed to raise awareness among schoolchildren of the need to preserve wetlands. Between land and water, wetlands provide many services and are characterised by exceptional biodiversity. However, wetlands are under pressure from human activities (agriculture, tourism, urbanisation). We will be focusing on the Natura 2000 site of the River Lez, which flows through Montpellier and its surrounding area, and on the European otter, a species that shares its life cycle between land and water and is an ambassador for wetlands. We'll be putting together an educational pack to raise awareness of the European otter and wetlands, which we'll be using in a number of events with schoolchildren in the metropolitan area. We will be organising a photo exhibition open to the public, showcasing the photographs taken by schoolchildren, as well as the work of the wildlife photographers who work on the Lez. Overall, MEDLEZ will help to foster a sense of attachment to the site and, through this feeling of connection with nature, raise awareness of the need to conserve biodiversity.
