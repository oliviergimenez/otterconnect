Vincent Sablain and Olivier Gimenez took part in the Agropol'Eat Festival and proposed an otter field trip on the banks of the Lez river. What is the Agropol'Eat Festival? It's a unique event held in the Agropolis district on the banks of the Lez river in Montpellier to share, explore and enjoy the issues of sustainable food, the environment and the preservation of biodiversity. You can also listen to Vincent [here](https://www.agropoleat-festival.com/capsule-vincent-sablain) and Olivier [there](https://www.agropoleat-festival.com/capsule-olivier-gimenez) in two sound clips, and find out more about their relationship with the river through their own experiences.
