We organised a field trip with colleagues from the city of Montpellier (which supports `OtterConnect`) to explain the objectives of the project. Everyone had a great time, and we even got to see [Lez sculpins](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabot_du_Lez) and [cistudes](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistude)! Stéphanie Grosset, Laurent Guillaume, Yann Raulet and Amélie Labbé were present, accompanied by Vincent Sablain and Olivier Gimenez for the project. All photos by Yann Raulet.
