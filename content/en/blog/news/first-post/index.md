The `OtterConnect` project is launched with the support of [Montpellier city](https://www.montpellier.fr/), de  [Montpellier Méditerranée Métropole](https://www.montpellier3m.fr/), and [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/) via [Labex Cemeb](https://www.labex-cemeb.org/).

In the `OtterConnect` project, we study connectivity on rivers in the Montpellier area (Hérault, Lez, Vidourle, Orb/Libron, Or), with the European otter (*Lutra lutra*) as a case study, and as an indicator of green and blue infrastructures. We use non-invasive monitoring methods such as environmental DNA, camera trapping, spraint collection, statistical modeling and social sciences.
