On December 15, we went on the Lez to do some scouting in anticipation of the installation of camera traps. Several people from our [Human Animal Interactions](https://human-animal-interactions.github.io/) team were there, including Louis Barbu, and Vincent Sablain from the [EPTB Lez] (https://eptb-lez.fr/) our guide. Louis and Vincent are two key people of the `OtterConnect` project.
