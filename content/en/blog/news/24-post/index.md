An update on our European otter projects. I talk about connectivity, the turquoise infrastructure, cam traps, eDNA, poo, human representations and scientific outreach. And did I mention poo? The slides are [here](https://figshare.com/articles/presentation/Loutre_Lez_connectivit_cologique_et_m_diation_scientifique_/24781776/1) and the video recording [there](https://figshare.com/articles/presentation/Loutre_Lez_connectivit_cologique_et_m_diation_scientifique_/24781776/1).
