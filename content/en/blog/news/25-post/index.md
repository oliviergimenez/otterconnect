In view of the increasing evidence of the presence of the European otter in the Or catchment area since 2020, the `Symbo` has decided to become a partner in the `OtterConnect` project. At the start of 2024, various otter detection protocols will be put in place in this area. Louise D'Hollande, a trainee appointed by the Symbo, with the support of Tatiana Tronel and Lucie Depinoy from the `Ecologistes de l'Euzière` association, as well as the `Service Espaces Naturels de Pays de l'Or agglomération`, the `Conservatoire du littoral` land around the Etang de l'Or, has begun surveys to define the sampling sites: Rivers but also marshes where several individuals have been observed.
