We are pleased to welcome Simon Lacombe as a PhD student for 3 years, supervised by Olivier Gimenez and SÃ©bastien Devillard. The aim of Simon's thesis is to provide a better understanding of the dynamics of the recolonisation of France by the European otter (Lutra lutra) using methods from statistical ecology. Simon will also compare new sampling methods for this species in order to promote its large-scale monitoring.
