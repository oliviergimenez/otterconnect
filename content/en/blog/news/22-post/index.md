The steering committee for the Natura 2000 site "Le Lez" met on Thursday 25 May. It was an afternoon rich in exchanges, bringing together 25 players from the "Le Lez" Natura 2000 site (elected representatives, government departments, associations, technicians, local residents, etc.) and the OtterConnect project was on the program.
