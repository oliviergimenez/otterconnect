On February 17, 23 and 24, we went back to our study sites to check out the cam traps. Some worked well with [nice surprises](https://otterconnect.netlify.app/blog/2023/01/20/first-videos-of-an-otter-on-the-lez-river/), others did not work due to incorrect settings, unfortunate locations, mysterious reasons, etc., but that's life. We had even more people coming on the field with us, including folks from [the school of nature management and protection](https://www.egpn.fr/).
